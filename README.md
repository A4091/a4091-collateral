# A4091 collateral material

This repository contains all the artsy and non-PCB/non-logic/non-software
pieces that went into making the ReAmiga 4091:

## The Box

The original box dimensions are:

| Length | Width | Height |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 43cm   | 16cm  | 6.5cm  |
| 16.92" | 6.3"  | 2.56"  |

At least one DKB box out there was confirmed with these dimensions:

| Length   | Width | Height |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 39cm     | 17cm  | 5cm    |

You can find the art work in the `box/` subdirectory. *NOTE:* The first batch
of boxes we had manufactured were 17" x 6.75" x 3.25" as we did not have any
exact measurements to go by.

## The Manual

The A4091 manual is 5.5" x 7.75" in size. If you get it professionally printed,
it is recommended to use the English only version to keep costs down. If you
are going to print all languages, you will probably need to choose Perfect
bound instead of Stapled bound.

Recommended configuration:
- Size: W: 5.5" H: 7.75"
- Grayscale
- 80lb Satin paper
- 24+4 pages
- Binding: Staple
- Cover: 110lb Satin paper
- Cover: Color
- Cover: Soft Touch Lamination


## Bracket

The metal bracket was designed by Szymon Gosk.

It is recommended to laser cut the bracket, but you will need the appropriate
equipment to perform the narrow dual bend that prevents the metal from making
contact with the connectors on the back of the card. Additionally it is
recommended to apply some foil into the double bend.

Feel free to [contact us](mailto:a4091@amiga.technology) if you need a bracket.
We might still have some left.

## Disk Labels

While the disk content is part of the a4091-software package, you can find a
set of disk labels here.

## Amiga 3000 LED adapter

A small adapter that lets you connect your A4091 to your A3000 LEDs. Gerbers
and KiCAD files included.

## Miscellaneous

There are a couple of 3d-printable designs available to accompany the A4091
SCSI controller.

- An enclosure for the A4091 Terminator. This enclosure comes in two versions,
  Version v1 is optimized for printing on an FDM printer as the text on the lid
  is recessed. Version v2 has embossed text and is better printed on a Resin
  printer.

- Szymon Gosk made a A4091 themed SCSI2SD adapter that you can 3d print
  yourself.

- There is also a newer version with a slightly different design that works
well with ZuluSCSI too.
