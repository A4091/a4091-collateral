# A4091 collateral material

This repository contains all the artsy and non-PCB/non-logic/non-software
pieces that went into making the ReAmiga 4091:

## The Box

The original box dimensions are:

| Length | Width | Height |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 43cm   | 16cm  | 6.5cm  |
| 16.92" | 6.3"  | 2.56"  |

At least one DKB box out there was confirmed with these dimensions:

| Length   | Width | Height |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 39cm     | 17cm  | 5cm    |

You can find the art work in the `box/` subdirectory. *NOTE:* The first batch
of boxes we had manufactured were 17" x 6.75" x 3.25" as we did not have any
exact measurements to go by.

## The Manual

The A4091 manual is 5.5" x 7.75" in size. If you get it professionally printed,
it is recommended to use the English only version to keep costs down. If you
are going to print all languages, you will probably need to choose Perfect
bound instead of Stapled bound.

Recommended configuration:
- Size: W: 5.5" H: 7.75"
- Grayscale
- 80lb Satin paper
- 24+4 pages
- Binding: Staple
- Cover: 110lb Satin paper
- Cover: Color
- Cover: Soft Touch Lamination


## Bracket

The metal bracket was designed by Szymon Gosk.

It is recommended to laser cut the bracket, but you will need the appropriate
equipment to perform the narrow dual bend that prevents the metal from making
contact with the connectors on the back of the card. Additionally it is
recommended to apply some foil into the double bend.

Feel free to [contact us](mailto:a4091@amiga.technology) if you need a bracket.
We might still have some left.

## Miscellaneous

- Szymon Gosk made a A4091 themed SCSI2SD bracket that you can 3d print
  yourself.
